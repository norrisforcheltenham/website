<div id="statement">
	<p>I'm Dan Norris, your Cheltenham Commissioner in Ward 5, and I'm running for re-election.</p>
	<p>
		As a Township Commissioner, I am committed to ensuring that our community is a safe and vibrant
		place to live, work, and play. I will strive to ensure that our township is well-maintained and
		that our residents have access to the resources they need to thrive. I will work to ensure that
		our township is a welcoming and inclusive place for all.
	</p>
	<p>
		Through strong fiscal management I will ensure that our tax dollars are properly spent and
		provide the necessary funding required by our libraries, fire companies, and community centers.
	</p>
	<p>
		I believe that every member of our community deserves to be heard and valued. That's why I
		maintain an open-door policy to all neighbors and work hard to be responsive to community needs.
		I am dedicated to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all residents of
		Cheltenham.
	</p>
	<p>
		Together, we can continue to build a strong and resilient community that we are all proud to
		call home. Thank you for your support.
